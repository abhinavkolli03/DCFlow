# discount.ai

discount.ai auto-generates financial valuation models based on historical data. 
Financial valuation models are a commodity in investing industry, but they can take hours to manually develop, posing risks of inaccuracies and employee strain.
With simply a company ticker, our app will generate a custom discounted cash flow model and provide it in a
standardized report format, fully equipped with dynamic macros and linking to allow users to modify as desired. 
Users can then ask questions about the company and valuation through an LLM to understand more about the model and broader macro trends.
